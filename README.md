# 📰 Fake News Detection System

A machine learning-based web application to detect fake news articles, built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/) 
<!-- REPLACE THE LINK ABOVE WITH YOUR ACTUAL DEPLOYED APP LINK AFTER DEPLOYING -->

## 🚀 Features

*   **Real-time Analysis**: Paste any news article to instantly check its authenticity.
*   **Confidence Score**: Displays the model's confidence probability.
*   **Simple & Clean UI**: Built with Streamlit for a responsive user experience.
*   **Machine Learning**: Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression trained on news datasets.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arvinth777/fake-news-detection.git
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate Model Files:**
    The app requires `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl`. You can generate these by running the included script.
    *   If you have the original `True.csv` and `Fake.csv` datasets, place them in the root directory to train on real data.
    *   If not, the script will create a demo model using dummy data.
    ```bash
    python generate_models.py
    ```

4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
